# Documentation Overview

This website provides an overview of [our work](overview/about-tabiya.md), the [approach behind the inclusive livelihoods taxonomy](overview/inclusive-livelihoods-taxonomy.md), and the [open taxonomy platform](overview/open-taxonomy-platform.md) that allows us to adapt and localize versions of the taxonomy for specific contexts. Each localized taxonomy will have a separate documentation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All documents here represent highly preliminary work in progress.
