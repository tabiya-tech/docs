# Documentation Overview

This website provides an overview of [our work](overview/about-tabiya.md), the [approach behind Tabiya's inclusive livelihoods taxonomy](overview/inclusive-livelihoods-taxonomy.md), and the [open taxonomy platform](overview/open-taxonomy-platform.md) that allows us to adapt and localize versions of the taxonomy for specific contexts. Each localized taxonomy will have a separate documentation. One can access the documentation on the South African taxonomy [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/R1Wzhnch8nFln8aM1Aec/s/eqaMpVpo5R72oRYDCE9R/).&#x20;

If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:hi@tabiya.tech). You can also create an [issue](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/docs/issues) in the [Github repository](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/docs/) that hosts this documentation.
