Compass is an innovative, AI-powered chatbot designed to revolutionize the way a young person identifies, articulates, and showcases their skills. Developed by Tabiya, Compass is a personal career assistant, helping youth uncover hidden talents and match them with the best opportunities in the job market.

## The Compass Solution

Compass is an open-source, conversational AI tool that:

1. Engages in **natural dialogue to explore** your experience
2. Analyzes a user's input to **identify and categorize skills** against localized [taxonomies](https://docs.tabiya.org/overview/projects/inclusive-livelihoods-taxonomy/open-taxonomy-platform)
3. Identifies **skills from both formal and informal work**
4. Creates **a comprehensive skills profile** tailored to the user
5. Generates a **professional customizable CV** highlighting oneâ€™s strengths
6. **Matches a user's skills** with relevant economic opportunities
7. Recommends **personalized recommendations** for skill development and career advancement.

Compass uses a large language model (LLM) and a conversational interface to help job seekers build a CV that highlights their skills. The tool combines a commercial LLM with a human-reviewed skills taxonomy for the labor market.

## Addressing Critical Challenges

In today's rapidly evolving job market, Compass tackles two persistent and interconnected problems that hinder effective workforce development:

* **Challenges in showcasing skills:** Crafting a CV that highlights relevant skills is tough for many job seekers. It's about translating experiences into terms that appeal to employers. This is harder for those with non-traditional or informal experience. A poor CV can lead to missed opportunities.
* **The scalability struggle:** Traditional methods rely heavily on human career counselors. While these professionals offer valuable insights, this approach has significant limitations.

Compass breaks down barriers by offering an AI solution that's scalable, affordable, and high-quality.
