# Core Version

Our [Inclusive Livelihoods Taxonomy](./) introduces important changes to [ESCO](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en) to better reflect the livelihoods and economic realities in low- and middle-income countries. This page presents our **standardized Core version, which is not country-specific.** We use our [Taxonomy Management Platform](open-taxonomy-platform.md)  to manage and maintain various adapted and country-specific versions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Core version of our taxonomy is continuously evolving. Regular updates integrate feedback, corrections, and new insights from our partners to better represent diverse economic activities.

## File Format and Download

### CSV File Format — Compatible with ESCO

Our taxonomy is distributed in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, ensuring ease of use, integration, and compatibility with existing ESCO-based systems.&#x20;
