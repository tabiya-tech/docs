# Livelihoods Classifier

The Tabiya Livelihoods Classifier provides an easy-to-use implementation of the entity-linking paradigm to support job description heuristics. &#x20;

Using state-of-the-art transformer neural networks this tool can extract 5 entity types: Occupation, Skill, Qualification, Experience, and Domain. For the Occupations and Skills,  ESCO-related entries are retrieved.  The procedure consists of two discrete steps, entity extraction and similarity vector search.
