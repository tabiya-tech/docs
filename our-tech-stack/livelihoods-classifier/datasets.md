## Training Sets

#### **Entity Extraction**

* **Location:** [ job\_ner\_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tabiya/job_ner_dataset)
* **Source:** [Green Benchmark corpus](https://github.com/acp19tag/skill-extraction-dataset)
* **Description:** This dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark suite for Entity Recognition (ER) in job descriptions. Developed to fill the significant gap in resources for extracting key entities like skills from job descriptions, the dataset features 18.6k annotated entities across five categories: Skill, Qualification, Experience, Occupation, and Domain.
* **License:** CC-BY-NC-4.0
* **Modifications:** No modifications were made to the original dataset. It was only converted to HuggingFace format.

#### **Entity Similarity**

* **Location:** TBD
* **Source:**[ hahu-occupation-titles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tabiya/occupation_titles_esco)
*   **Description:**&#x20;

    The `hahu_test.csv` file is the original file provided by Hahu Jobs with the following fields:

    * title: The title of the job position, indicating the specific role and/or position within the organization.
    * esco\_label: The preferred or alternative label provided by ESCO, matching the corresponding ESCO code.
    * esco\_code: The ESCO code associated with the job, facilitating standardized classification and comparison across different job listings.
* **License:** CC-BY-NC-4.0
* **Modifications:** Extracted Occupation title and relevant ESCO code and matched with preferred and alternative labels.

## Evaluation Sets

#### Hahu Test

* **Location**: inference/files/eval/redacted\_hahu\_test\_with\_id.csv
* **Source**: [hahu\_test](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tabiya/hahu_test)
* **Description**: This dataset consists of 542 entries chosen at random from the 11 general classification system of the Ethiopian hahu jobs platform. 50 entries were selected from each class to create the final dataset.
* **License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International see Data License for details.
* **Modifications**: No modifications were made to the selected entries.

#### House and Tech

* **Location**:
  * inference/files/eval/house\_test\_annotations.csv
  * inference/files/eval/house\_validation\_annotations.csv
  * inference/files/eval/tech\_test\_annotations.csv
  * inference/files/eval/tech\_validation\_annotations.csv
* **Source**: Provided by [Decorte et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05987)
* **Description**: The dataset includes the HOUSE and TECH extensions of the SkillSpan Dataset. In the original work by Decorte et al., the test and development entities of the SkillSpan Dataset were annotated into the ESCO model.
* **License**: MIT, Please refer to the original source.
* **Modifications**: The datasets were used as provided without further modifications.

#### Qualification Mapping

* **Location**: inference/files/eval/qualification\_mapping.csv
* **Source**: Extended from the [Green Benchmark](https://github.com/acp19tag/skill-extraction-dataset) Qualifications
* **Description**: This dataset maps the Green Benchmark Qualifications to the appropriate EQF levels. Two annotators tagged the qualifications, resulting in a Cohen's Kappa agreement of 0.45, indicating moderate agreement.
* **License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International see Data License for details.
* **Modifications**: Extended the dataset to include EQF level mappings and the annotations were verified by two annotators.
