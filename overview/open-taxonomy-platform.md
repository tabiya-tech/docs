# Open Taxonomy Platform

We are currently developing the **Open Taxonomy Platform,** which lets partners flexibly adapt our reference taxonomy in a transparent way. The platform also provides access to all taxonomies through an API, which allows users to query the platform for information on specific occupations or tasks.

The platform is currently under active open-source development. You can [follow along and contribute on Github](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/taxonomy-model-application). If you would like to learn more, please [get in touch](mailto:hi@tabiya.tech).
