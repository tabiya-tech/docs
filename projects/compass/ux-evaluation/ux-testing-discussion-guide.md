## Introduction and Warm-up

Hi \[participant’s name], thank you so much for taking the time to join me today! &#x20;

My name is \[moderator name], and I'm helping with a research project to understand how a new tool called Compass might be able to assist job seekers in their job search journey.&#x20;

Compass uses research and AI to help job seekers explore their skills and provides guidance on how best to leverage them in their job search.&#x20;

Your feedback will help us make improvements to Compass so it can work better for job seekers like yourself. &#x20;
